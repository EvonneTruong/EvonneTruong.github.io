  <h1> Artist Statement</h1>
  <p> I am a graphic designer who works to create clean minimal designs that effectively convey the content of the project. ​I created websites layouts, logos, layouts for printed brochures drawing​ on minimal designs that encourages one to look past the obvious and hone in on the unifying elements. As a designer I constantly have to consider the audience and employer and work to communicate the information in an informative but aesthetically pleasing manner. The challenge is to create more than what is required of the project, while keeping a clean but unique compositions.  My goal is to challenge myself and learn to continue to expand and incorporate new techniques to create unique visual identities.

	My most recent works are a fictional style guide for a non profit organization and a pamphlet for a fictional museum showing. Both work are united by the minimal design but differ in appearance and mood. They are both month long projects done for a graphic design communication class.

<br>
<br>
My works range from web layouts, company style guides, and other layouts. I focus on creating a balance between minimal design and presenting all necessary information while designing an aesthetically pleasing appearance. My work takes on variety of forms meant to draw in the viewers. My work focus most on minimalist aesthetics with a emphasis on clean graphics and popping colors, meant to convey information to a targeted audience.
