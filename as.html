  <h1> Artist Statement</h1>
  <p> Evonne Truong is a graphic designer who works to create clean minimal designs that effectively convey the content of the project. ​I created websites layouts, logos, layouts for printed brochures drawing​ heavily on minimal designs that encourages one to look past the obvious and hone in on the unifying elements. As a designer I constantly have to consider the audience and employer and work to communicate the information in an informative but aesthetically pleasing manner. The challenge is to create more than what is required of the project, while keeping a clean but unique compositions.  My goal is to challenge myself and learn to continue to expand and incorporate styles and aesthetics of other countries to create unique visual identities.
